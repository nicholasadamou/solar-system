## THREE.js Solar System

![preview](previews/preview.gif)

Our Solar System built using THREE.js. The planets and their orbital speeds are roughly to scale, however distances between planets are significantly scaled down (roughly 1/4 the actual distance) in order to provide a more engaging experience.
